This made me stuck in one place. \n\n\nUntil I realized, if I keep being quiet, I won\u2019t ever grow and learn. \nSo now, the first thing I do when I wake up is leetcode problems. \nI go to deeply technical meetups. \nI make friends with excellent engineers and scientists. \n\nAnd I am finally okay with looking like a fool and learning as much as I can. As fearlessly as I can.\n\nThis is a reminder, to never let your environment dictate how you should feel about yourself.\n\nInstead use it as a source of inspiration to propel you forward. \n \n#datascience #adhd #mentalhealth #leetcode #impostersyndrome",

        "content": "Yesterday, the creator of Pandas, Wes McKinney, was asked to give advice for Data Scientists, so he answered with a shocking response: \" Learn SQL. \" \ud83e\udd2f\n\nI didn't believe what I heard. The creator of one of the largest Python libraries with 60 million downloads every month, tells everyone to learn SQL!\n \nI chuckled but was intrigued to hear his explanation. \n\nHere is what he said: \n\n\" Well, some people on the Discord are going to laugh because I'm going to say that learning SQL is actually a really good skill. It's not just learning SQL the language, but learning the concepts of relational algebra and how to think about data sets, designing schemas, and  organizing data.\"\n\n...\n\n\"It is about learning the file formatting and the basics of data storage, data partitioning, and the relationship between the execution engines. All of these things will yield you to be a better DBT user, a better Snowflake user or a Databricks user.\n\n...\n\n\"Ultimately, it might seem like the wizard behind the curtain, but I think a lot of these systems have very similar architectures and properties. This will help you understand how these systems work and how to use them effectively.\"\n\n...\n\nI loved the advice and we have a lot to learn from him. \nWhy? Because of his impressive contributions and his background: \ud83d\udc47\n\n\n- Wes McKinney is a notable figure in the open-source community. \n\n- He dropped out of college to develop the Pandas library.\n\n- He co-founded the Apache Arrow project, a cross-language development platform for in-memory data.\n\n- He developed the Ibis project, which provides a more efficient way to bridge SQL and Python for data analysis. (Which is pretty cool)\n\n- He published O'Reily book -\u00a0\"Python for Data Analysis,\" a widely-used reference book for learning Pandas. \n\n...\n\nIf you haven't heard about him or his work yet (which I doubt),  I highly encourage you to check out Chip Huyen's YouTube for the recording. \n\nLink in the comments.",

But! Fundamentals underneath these tools stay forever. You need to learn to walk before you can run!\n\nFocus on these first: \n\n\ud83d\udd11 Understand Neural Networks\nLLMs are built on neural networks, so getting a handle on the basics like layers, activation functions, and backpropagation will take you further than focusing on the latest AI fad.\nStart here: Neural Networks and Deep Learning - https://lnkd.in/gsPi-nSj\n\n\ud83d\udd11 Prompt Engineering Basics\nLLMs are only as good as the prompts they receive. Learning the fundamentals of crafting effective prompts can help you get better results from any AI coding assistant or LLM tool.\nStart here: Prompt Engineering Guide - https://lnkd.in/gtVtw5nU\n\n\ud83d\udd11 Data Curation & Preparation\nLLMs need vast amounts of data to perform well. Understanding how to clean, preprocess, and organize data will always be a high-demand skill in this space.\nStart here: Training & Fine-Tuning:  Data -https://lnkd.in/gmMApezn\n\n\ud83d\udd11 NLP & LLM Fundamentals\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is the heart of LLMs. Get familiar with concepts like tokenization, embeddings, and attention mechanisms to understand what drives LLM performance.\nStart here: Andrej Karpathy\u2019s Zero to Hero playlist - https://lnkd.in/gQuHDJup\n\n\ud83d\udd11 Model Deployment & Scaling\nKnowing how to deploy, fine-tune, and monitor LLMs in production is just as important as building them.

An End-to-End ML Pipeline\nSkills to demonstrate: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, deployment, and monitoring.\nTrust me you will learn a LOT by doing this. \n\n2. A State-of-the-Art Model Implementation\u00a0\nSkills to demonstrate: Deep understanding of cutting-edge algorithms, ability to read and implement research papers,by translating math equations into working Python code. \n\n3. Find A Real-World Problem you care about.\u00a0\nSkills to demonstrate: Problem framing, business impact assessment, data acquisition, approach and tech stack selection, ethical considerations, and project documentation. \n\nYou could integrate all 3 aspects into one comprehensive project or showcase them separately. The key is demonstrating your ability to tackle real-world ML challenges and make a tangible impact. \n\nStop endlessly consuming courses and start building!\n\nIf you want to learn more about how to build a portfolio join our event, where we will share 20+ project ideas and guidelines in Data, AI & ML: \n\nhttps://lu.ma/yxn73k6q\n\n\n\ud83c\udf81 Once you register, we will email you a PDF and a recording!\n\nHappy coding!\n\n#machinelearning",

        "content": "Yesterday I had a mentorship call with a recent graduate who wanted to break into ML. The first thing I heard was: \"I want to learn LLMs and Neural Networks to land my first job. \"\n\nThis is something I hear every day and truthfully I get it. I did the same thing when I was just starting out. I thought if I could show them I could build the \"hard things\" I would stand out from the competition. \n\nI was very wrong. \n\nIf your goal is to get a job in ML, you need to NAIL the fundamentals, which usually involves Statistics, Python, and ML algorithms, and building a relevant portfolio! \n\nAnd if later on, you want to transition to Deep Learning, these skills will provide you with a solid foundation and you will do it with much ease. \nBut first, align your skills to the actual job requirements!",

An End-to-End ML Pipeline\nSkills to demonstrate: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, deployment, and monitoring.\nTrust me you will learn a LOT by doing this. \n\n2. A State-of-the-Art Model Implementation \nSkills to demonstrate: Deep understanding of cutting-edge algorithms, ability to read and implement research papers,by translating math equations into working Python code. \n\n3. Find A Real-World Problem you care about. \nSkills to demonstrate: Problem framing, business impact assessment, data acquisition, approach and tech stack selection, ethical considerations, and project documentation. \n\nYou could integrate all 3 aspects into one comprehensive project or showcase them separately. The key is demonstrating your ability to tackle real-world ML challenges and make a tangible impact. \n\nStop endlessly consuming courses and start building!\nYour future in ML starts with hands-on experience.\n\nIf you want to learn more about how to build a portfolio read this article:\nhttps://lnkd.in/g7sTg8Re \n\nHappy coding!\n\n#machinelearning",

The days of HTML tag parsing using Beautiful Soup and long hours of cleaning are officially gone. \n\nNow, you can use an LLM-powered tool called \ud835\udc09\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1a \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc08 that:\n\n1.

Then it automatically removes unnecessary HTML tags, normalizes the text, and organizes it into JSON or a more human-readable format, like plain text. \n\n3.  It is less detected and is less likely to be blocked by websites because it doesn't have repetitive patterns and high request rates. \n\nAnd the best part is - it is free!\n\nI don\u2019t know what the deal is with them. \n\nBut I am grateful I found it. \n\nI will use this to feed my RAG libraries. \n\n...\n\nWhat will you do with it? \n\n\nLegal Disclaimer:\nThe information provided here is for educational purposes only.

        "content": "In 2021, I hit rock bottom and found myself $45,000 in debt after filing for business bankruptcy.\n\nI felt ashamed for not knowing better. I didn\u2019t know how to pay off the debt or what to do with my career...\n\nBut I knew one thing: I wanted to get smarter. \nSmarter with numbers and with data, so I\u2019d never find myself in such a financial pit again.\n\nThat\u2019s when I learned about Data Analytics. I was excited to build hard skills that would always be in demand. But as I started researching, I became more and more overwhelmed.\n\nWith no one to guide me, I would purchase random courses and give up halfway through. My undiagnosed ADHD would make it worse. This cycle repeated until I was almost ready to give up.\n\nAt that pivotal moment, I met my ex-partner, a Data Scientist. I was blown away by his depth of knowledge and his natural enthusiasm for Data Science. He would share interesting AI concepts with so much passion\u2014it was admirable.\n\nHe suggested I follow the Data Science field instead, because of its abundant opportunities and higher ceiling for growth. So I followed his advice. \n\nVery soon, I realized that I didn\u2019t have any support system.\n\nWhile my peers had entire university faculties focused on helping them learn and get a job, I was by myself in a different country, far away from family, trying to break into data.\n\nSo I decided to put my pride aside and ask him for guidance.\nTo my surprise, for our next coffee date, he prepared introductory presentation slides to teach me Data Science fundamentals.\n\nI still remember that day as if it was yesterday. He presented on Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques and gave me few articles to read. \n\nAfter our first few lectures and discussions, it suddenly seemed less scary and complex.\n\nI cried because that new perspective changed everything for me.\n\nThe best part was he never looked down on me and always treated me as an equal.\nThis way, I was able to learn fast, and in less than a year, I landed my first job in tech, where I worked with Computer Vision and Robotics. \n\nI paid off my debt and opened a savings account for the first time in my life.\n\n---\n\nSometimes all you need is kindness and encouragement from one person at the right time. \n\nThank you for being that person when I needed it the most. \n\n---\n\nFast forward to now, as I lead a Data Science Community, I strive to pay it forward by guiding others on their transition journey.\n\nRemember, the right support can change everything.\n\nDon't be afraid to reach out and connect with those who inspire you. \n\nYour breakthrough might just be a few conversations away.\n\n#datascience #careertransition #impostersyndrome",

        "content": "Your entire career can change in 1 year. \n\n10 simple ways to transform your ML skills in 2024: \n\n1. Set quarterly goals\nEvery 3 months, set a new learning goal. Whether it\u2019s mastering a specific branch of ML-like CV or NLP, or practicing a new programming language, like Python, focus and learn only 1-3 at a time. \n\n2. Embrace code sprints\nDedicate at least 2-4 hours every weekend to building small ML projects. From implementing ML algorithms to integrating new libraries like Hugging Face Transformers, you need to learn by doing! \n\n3. Implement the \"Paper-a-Week\" habit\nRead one ML research paper every week and summarize it in your own words. This helps you stay updated with cutting-edge tech and sharpens your ability to think critically about new methods. (Check out BuildML) \n\n4. Use Leetcode-like challenges \nBuild problem-solving skills by working on Leetcode-style coding challenges related to DSA. Practice these every day if you want to stay interview-ready. \n\n5. Participate in Kaggle Competitions or Hackathons at least once a month\nI built awesome ML & AI apps and made life-long connections through hackathons. Truly a great opportunity to accelerate learning.\n\n6. Join Accountability Groups\nFind or create a small group of ML learners and share your weekly progress. Regular check-ins will keep you motivated to show up and improve your tech communication skills. \n\n7. Document Everything\nStart a blog, LinkedIn series, or GitHub repository where you explain concepts or share projects. Teaching others solidifies your own knowledge, and builds a network of like-minded people!\n\n8. Master One Tool Per Month\nWhether it\u2019s a new framework (like PyTorch Lightning), a cloud service (like AWS Sagemaker), or an automation tool (like MLflow), diving into one tool each month builds familiarity with industry-wide accepted tools, which will make you job-ready!\n\n9. Enroll in a Bootcamp or Take Online Courses\nIf you have a hard time learning by yourself, then invest in a structured learning environment like bootcamps or courses on Coursera, Datacamp, or Udemy that have a solid roadmap. \n\n10. Contribute to open-source \nThere are so many amazing repos that need tweaking and fixing. This is a great opportunity for you to get a taste of engineering workflows. Not to mention the networking opportunities you can get! \n\n\n...\n\nEnjoy this? \n\n\nWe will be launching an exclusive community at Break Into Data, where you can build these amazing habits together with other like-minded professionals. \n\n\nFill out this form to help us learn your goals!\nhttps://lnkd.in/g6eh5ENi\nAnd get notified first when we launch!\n\n\ud83d\ude80",

Theory and application should go hand in hand!\nAction: For every new ML concept you learn, set aside time to implement a simple version or experiment with it using a small dataset.\n\n\nRule #2 - Learn the math from the source code\n\nWhen importing popular ML libraries, don't just use them as black boxes. Dive into the source code to understand the math that's running the show under the hood. \nAction: Choose a simple ML model from a popular library (like scikit-learn) and reverse engineer its source code with underlying logic and math.  (This is like watching a fitness coach squat and trying to learn his form)\n\n\nRule #3 - Build from scratch\n\nBefore jumping to the next model, give yourself at least 30 minutes to try building that model from scratch using only NumPy and Python. \nAction: After learning about the fundamental logic behind this new ML algorithm, try to recreate own implementation. (This is like actually squatting)\n\nA small gift for you. \ud83c\udf81 \n\nThis free\u00a0ML from Scratch Course (https://lnkd.in/g6fcGD8N) takes you through writing 10 algorithms from scratch with nothing but Python and NumPy! \n\n- K-Nearest Neighbors\n- Linear Regression\n- Logistic Regression\n- Decision Trees\n- Random Forest\n- Naive Bayes\n- PCA\n- Perceptron\n- SVM\n- K-Means\n\n\n...\n\n\nDon't wait! \n\nFollow Break Into Data's motto: \n\nBuild.

He then proceeded to learn Portuguese and land large contracts in Latin America. \n\n\nStories like Gus\u2019s really inspire me.\n\nDon\u2019t underestimate what you can achieve in less than 5 years. \n\nPut in the work now. \n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nBe like Gus. \n\nBe relentless. \n\nLearn continuously. \n\nTake massive actions.",

        "content": "Python is a #1 skill for ML engineering. \n\nYou can see how important it is on Luke Barousse's job analytics board that has over 45k ML positions.\n\nEven though these days we have AI coding helpers, you still need to understand many fundamental Python concepts to pass ML and Data Science interviews. \n\nHere are 7 main concepts you need to know for Python interview rounds: \n\n1. Data Structures: Explain and utilize Python's built-in data structures like lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples. Be prepared to talk about when to use each type and their performance differences. \n\n2. Control Flow: Be familiar with conditional statements (if,\u00a0elif,\u00a0else) and loops (for,\u00a0while). You should also know how to use list comprehensions for more concise code.\n\n3. Functions and Scope: Know how to define functions, the concept of scope (local vs. global variables), and how to use\u00a0*args\u00a0and\u00a0**kwargs\u00a0for flexible function arguments.\n\n4. Error Handling: Understand how to handle exceptions using\u00a0try,\u00a0except,\u00a0finally, and how to raise exceptions. \n\n5. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Be able to explain the principles of OOP\u2014classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. You may be asked to implement a simple class structure.\n\n6. Libraries and Frameworks: Learn key functions from popular libraries like NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. Be prepared to discuss their use cases and how to implement them. \n\n7. Data Manipulation: Know how to manipulate data using pandas, including cleaning, filtering, grouping, merging, and reshaping data. \n\n8. Algorithms: Be ready to implement common machine learning algorithms from scratch, such as logistic regression or random forest. Understand the underlying mathematics and logic behind these algorithms so you can build them on your own with Python. \n\n...\n\nI personally found Jay Feng's Interview Query platform to be the best resource to practice ML questions. \n\nCheck it out with the link below. \n\nI hope it makes your prep a little easier!\n\n\n#python #ml",

You can pivot and start from scratch at any age and still succeed, just like these folks:\n\n- Vera Wang, who was a figure skater and journalist, before owning the fashion industry at age 40.\n\n- Ray Kroc, who used to sell paper cups before he launched McDonald's expansion at age 52. \n\n- Stewart Butterfield, who worked as a freelance web designer, before building Slack in his 40s. \n\nAt the end of the day, it doesn't matter what other people think. \n\nWhat matters is, if you truly know yourself. \nWhat makes you tick? What are you naturally good at? \n\nThe only way to discover this is by trying different things and not being afraid to fail.\n\nKeep experimenting until you find what works best for you. \nAfter that, it's all about staying consistent.\n\nKeep going!\n\n#mentalhealth",

But it hasn\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019ve realized that mental health isn\u2019t something you can \u201cfix\u201d once and be happy for the rest of your life. It's an ongoing process of facing yourself at your worst and extending genuine compassion. \n\nI know I\u2019m not alone in this. So many of us carry mental health burdens from childhood into adulthood, and it can feel extremely shameful and isolating.\n\nThat is why talking about it is so important! \nIt makes us more human.\nIt makes us be okay with not being okay. \n\nToday, I want to help lighten your burden and share some tools that truly pulled me through dark times. \nUse them whenever you feel off: \n\n- Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) - helps me tremendously in processing my emotions. \nResource: Brad Yates' Youtube, always makes me feel better.\nhttps://lnkd.in/g9tiQvuA \n\n- Understanding C-PTSD \nResource: Heidi Priebe, a brilliant guide to understanding yourself better.\n https://lnkd.in/gzDTCDHz\n\n- Understanding your emotions \nResource: Therapy in a nutshell, amazing short lectures on EI. \nhttps://lnkd.in/gzFCs6Qp\n\n- Qi Gong to balance your energy \nResource: Always brings me back to balance and back on my feet. \nhttps://lnkd.in/gdWx_QFh\n\n...\n\nRemember your emotional health matters as much as your physical health.\nTake care of yourself this week!\n\n...\n\nThese are the things that worked for me. \n\nI am curious to know, what helps you process your emotions? \nShare in the comments, so we can all learn from each other.",

Instead, you screenshot them and use AI to break them down for you. After all, you are an insatiably curious monkey. \n\n2. You are focusing more on the data. \nBefore mastering ML models, you are learning to deal with messy data. \n60-80% of your time goes into data preprocessing and applying new cleaning techniques specific to the data type and algorithms.  \n\n3. You are no longer distracted by shiny new AI models and tools. \nYou can distinguish between value and noise. FOMO can't catch you. Instead, you focus on filling your knowledge gaps in fundamentals like statistics, math, and programming. \n\n4. You know what you don't know. \nYou frequently hear many repeating ML terms that you don't yet understand.  Instead of disregarding it, you make notes and get back to them in your free time. \n\n5. You are working on your soft skills. \nYou finally understand that building hard skills is not enough. That is why you make an effort to explain complex things in a simple way to non-technical stakeholders. You know that's where you make the biggest impact in your career. \n\n6. You are being patient with yourself.\nYou are no longer rushing to learn everything in 3 months or threatening to quit it altogether. You found your comfortable pace and made learning your daily habit. Just like going to the gym, but instead of strengthening muscles, you're strengthening your brain.\n\n\nI hope you are proud of your journey! \nBecause I, sure am. \n\nKeep going!\n\n\n#machinelearning",

        "content": "You can\u2019t call yourself a Machine Learning Engineer if you don\u2019t know how to deploy your models. \n\nAnd no it is not just about wrapping functions in API endpoints using Flask or BentoML and calling it a day. \n\nWhen I ran the ML Coding Challenge Break Into Data, I advised participants to work on smaller problems which meant working on one model. \n\nHowever, in reality,  big tech companies have hundreds and thousands of models running in production at any given moment. \n\nAnd every single model has its own complex deployment architecture that corresponds to their software and product requirements. \n\n\nSo here are 4 main deployment strategies you should know: \n\n\n1. Batch prediction (Figure 1) - The predictions are generated at defined frequencies and stored in a SQL or in-memory database and retrieved as needed. For example, Amazon might generate top recommended products every 4 hours and they are shown to users when they log in.\u00a0You can read more about the architecture here - https://lnkd.in/gAbRCvdX \n\n\n2. Online prediction (Figure 2) - Rather than wait hours or days for predictions, we can generate predictions as soon as they are needed and serve these to users right away. Online inferencing also allows us to make predictions with recent streaming features, like product or user activity updates made in the last 10 minutes. \u00a0You can read more on the differences between online and batch prediction here - https://lnkd.in/ggV7xGaS \n\n\n3. Real-time deployment (Figure 3) - It is one of the hardest deployment architectures. It requires that the reaction to requests must be fulfilled within a matter of milliseconds. Consider, stock market predictions, air traffic control use cases, where latency is one of the highest priorities. To handle additional parallel requests from other users, you need to count on multi-threaded processes and vertical scaling by adding additional servers. Learn more here - https://lnkd.in/gQHKyqS6\n\n\n4. Edge deployment (Figure 4)- It is when the model is directly deployed on the client such as the local machine, a mobile phone or IoT products. This allows offline predictions that result in the fastest inferences. Models need to be lightweight to fit on the smaller hardware pieces.\u00a0Check out a CV use case here - https://lnkd.in/g8KSxXTG\n\n\n\u2026\n\nIf you want to learn more about Practical ML Engineering, sign up here\u00a0- merinova.substack.com\n\n#machinelearning #ai",

Python remains the most popular programming language among winners, with 63 out of 65 winning solutions primarily or exclusively using Python.\n\n2. PyTorch remains by far the most popular deep learning library, in a two-horse race \u2014 out of 53 solutions using deep learning, 47 primarily used PyTorch, 4 used TensorFlow, and 2 used both PyTorch and TensorFlow.\n\n3. The most popular models for computer vision remain both CNNs (convolutional neural networks) and Transformers. With the most popular being \u00a0ConvNeXt and U-Net (CNN) architectures. \n\n4. Winners of the most notable LLM competition at Kaggle used an ensemble of five 7B-parameter LLMs and one 13B-parameter LLM, which they fine-tuned, alongside\u00a0Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u00a0on a chunked local version of Wikipedia. \n\n5. Over 70% of winners used a GPU to train their model, and many of these used powerful data-center GPUs rather than cheaper consumer-oriented ones.\n\n6. Polars, the dataframe library written in Rust, is starting to see adoption among competition winners, with its improved performance compared to Pandas.\n\n\nP.S.

Get the data in a CSV.\n\n- Connect OpenAI API to analyze your data and turn it into a short, meaningful message that sounds like you. \n\n- Add APIs like Whatsapp to send automated messages.\n\n- Deploy on Hugging Face or set up a FastAPI server on GCP as an extra challenge.\n\n- Schedule your script with a daily CRON job to send updates every morning.\n\n- Improve the messages based on feedback to make them more personal and insightful over time.\n\n\n...\n\n\nYour imagination is your only limitation. \n\n\n#aiengineering",

        "content": "My\u00a05 biggest takeaways from yesterday's hottest AI  Conference in SF in under 5 minutes. \n\n\n\u23e9\u00a0RAG is the future. 80% Of yesterday's talks were focused on building the best-performing retrieval architecture for private databases. Chip Huyen proposes to start with simple retrieval techniques like BM25 and leaving fine-tuning as a last resort, due to its high maintenance requirements and dependence on foundational models. (Picture 2)\n\n\u23e9\u00a0Data Quality is everything. Chad Sanderson introduces the importance of Data Contracts at SLA level and urges us to leverage them to ensure Data Quality across teams. LLamaIndex CEO, Jerry Liu shared the same sentiment and reminded us to avoid Garbage in Garbage out situation as much as possible. (Picture 3)\n\n\u23e9\u00a0Graphs + RAGs = A promising marriage. Graphs capture semantic and hierarchical relationships across your datasets, significantly lowering the hallucinations for complex queries. In particular, Daniel Svonava's talk on controlling RAG results and his recent Knowledge Graph and RAG architecture caught my eye. Check it out here  - https://lnkd.in/ggpj9Qex\n \n\u23e9\u00a0Everyone wants Data Scientists to be friends with DEs and MLEs. Catherine Nelson wrote an entire book on equipping Data Scientists with the engineering fundamental skills for that specific reason. (See last slide) We all want Data scientists to move away from notebooks. \n\n\u23e9\u00a0Overall, 2024 is a year of LLMs in production. As Eugene Yan says in his famous article \ud835\udc16\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc30\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc26 \ud835\udc1a \ud835\udc32\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1f \ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc30\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21 \ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc2c: \"It is time to move away from 0 to 1 and get to N from 1\". And I couldn't agree more. We had enough time to play around with prototyping. Whatever makes the foundational models hallucinate less will become extremely valuable. Enforcing AI Guardrails, Schema prompting, and Introducing new Evaluation frameworks will accelerate LLM adoption in 2024. \n\n\nIt is time to make the VC firms happy and focus on the ROI and PMF, so we won't end up with mass layoffs all over again. \n\n\n\n\nOther honorable mentions: \n\nKirk Marple - Great talk on Graphs and RAGs .\nRick Lamers - Amazing technical slides on tool use and function calling with LLMs \nJoe Reis \ud83e\udd13 - Data Engineering expert. \nDemetrios Brinkmann - Founder of MLOps community.  \nSonam G. - Podcast Host and Community builder\n\n\nHad an amazing time and met many interesting speakers who will talk at Break Into Data very soon!\n\n...\n\nFollow for the current state of applied ML and LLMs at - merinova.substack.com\n\n\n#AIQCon",

        "content": "AI Engineering has fundamentally transformed from traditional ML Engineering, and here's what matters now:\n\n- foundation model adaptation \nUnderstanding prompt engineering, fine-tuning, RAG, and Agents is critical now, rather than building models from scratch. \n\n- infrastructure optimization \nWhether you're working with cloud AI solutions like AWS Sagemaker, and Vertex AI, or inference optimization tools like vLLM, understanding how to efficiently deploy and scale large language models is crucial.\n\n- evaluation frameworks \nWith open-ended outputs from LLMs, traditional ML metrics aren't enough. Knowledge of evaluation techniques for generative AI, including human feedback systems and automated evaluation frameworks, is becoming increasingly important.\n\n- cost optimization \nManaging inference and fine-tuning costs for large models with exponentially increasing API calls, while maintaining performance is the next big in-demand skill. \n\n\nThe future of AI engineering isn't about building models from scratch anymore, it's about:\n \n- getting first to market \n- solving real problems and finding PMF asap\n- improving and innovating on the UX \n- effectively adapting, deploying,  \n- and evaluating AI systems at scale!\n\n\nThe game has changed for 2025. \n\nIt's time to build like a maniac.",

        "content": "Why do most startups prefer GraphRAG over RAG? \n\nAlthough RAG architectures are powerful on their own, they have painful limitations that need to be addressed: \n\n- they lack structure: Document embedding captures semantic meaning but struggles to capture themes and relationships across the entire document corpus, which lowers retrieval quality. \n- challenges with scalability: As the database volume grows, the retrieval process becomes less efficient, as the computational load increases with the search space.\n- data challenges: Traditional RAG systems don't easily accommodate diverse data, which are harder to embed. (think PDFs, Flat files, HTML, CSVs, Web content, etc)\n\nWe can address those issues with GraphRAG. \n\nGraphs are the best at representing and storing diverse and interconnected information in a structured manner. \n\nThe most exciting part is that these days you don't even have to populate the graph yourself!\u00a0 An LLM can parse and categorize entities and their relationships, inferring all from the database itself.\n\nIf you want to learn more about how I built a GraphRAG with Wikipedia articles, check out my \u201cRAG with Langchain\u201d course on DataCamp. \n\nYou can take the first chapter for free or sign up during their Black Friday 50% off promo. \n\nHere is the link: https://lnkd.in/gnGXMkTe",

The creator of one of the largest Python libraries with 60 million downloads every month, tells everyone to learn SQL!\n \nI chuckled but was intrigued to hear his explanation. \n\nHere is what he said: \n\n\" Well, some people on the Discord are going to laugh because I'm going to say that learning SQL is actually a really good skill. It's not just learning SQL the language, but learning the concepts of relational algebra and how to think about data sets, designing schemas, and organizing data.\"\n\n...\n\n\"It is about learning the file formatting and the basics of data storage, data partitioning, and the relationship between the execution engines. All of these things will yield you to be a better DBT user, a better Snowflake user or a Databricks user.\n\n...\n\n\"Ultimately, it might seem like the wizard behind the curtain, but I think a lot of these systems have very similar architectures and properties. This will help you understand how these systems work and how to use them effectively.\"\n\n...\n\nI loved the advice and we have a lot to learn from him. \nWhy? Because of his impressive contributions and his background: \ud83d\udc47\n\n\nWes McKinney is a notable figure in the open-source community!\n\n- He dropped out of college to develop the Pandas library.\n\n- He co-founded the Apache Arrow project, a cross-language development platform for in-memory data.\n\n- He developed the Ibis project, which provides a more efficient way to bridge SQL and Python for data analysis. \n\n- He published O'Reily book -\u00a0\"Python for Data Analysis,\" a widely-used reference book for learning Pandas. \n\n...\n\nIf you haven't heard about him or his work yet, I highly encourage you to register for tomorrow\u2019s Live session!\nWhere you can ask questions and learn from his journey. \n\n\nRegister here \ud83d\udc47\n\nhttps://lu.ma/i80kh30z",

They are hiring their first ML engineer!\u00a0Make sure to reach out. \n\n\n#startup #femalefounders #dataanalytics #ai",

But nobody says how?\n\nTomorrow we will have Nirmal Budhathoki as a guest speaker at Break Into Data. \n\nHe will share what worked for him during his unique Career Transition journey. \n\n- He was born and raised in a small town in Nepal\n- Moved to the USA for graduate school in 2007.\n- Graduated during the Great Recession, but couldn't find a job. \n- So he joined the US Army instead. \n- The military was tough and many times he felt like giving up and leaving back home. \n\nBut this is my favorite part of his story: \n\n\"In early 2014- I had to make a tough decision: whether to continue in military or transition out. I had no job lined up, and my wife was still unemployed. My mind said - renew the military contract, but my heart said- take a risk to find a job that fits your goal. I asked my wife for advice, and she suggested me: Go with your heart, we will manage it. She has always been my mentor.\" \n\nFollowing that pivotal moment, he was able to secure a job as a Data Analyst with the US Navy within a month of leaving the military. Later on, he landed his first job as a Data Scientist with Wells Fargo in 2019.\n\nAnd the rest is history. \n\nIf you are thinking of transitioning towards Data Science, but don't know where to begin, join us at Break Into Data's Discord Server with Nirmal Budhathoki and ask him how he did it!\n\nThe event will take place at 12 PM Pacific time tomorrow June 21st, 2024. \n\nRegister here to get the invite link - https://lnkd.in/gAbw54E7",

Ignore your interests to follow the crowd, and end up with a portfolio that screams \"template\" rather than \"talent.\"\n6. blindly apply to every job that starts with \"data\"\n7. overload your resume with buzzwords like Hadoop, Big Data, and Microsoft Paint, despite never using them.  \n8. stress on landing a job in 6 months or never try again. \n9. blame everything else instead of reflecting on your strategy. \n\n\nThe best way to break into data :\n\n1.  identify the specific areas of data science that genuinely interest you, like Computer Vision, NLP,  RecSys, or Forecasting. \n2.  network like your career depends on it - because it does. (attend meetups, join communities, make more data friends)\n3.  reach out to real professionals, not just instructors, and learn what skills truly matter on the job\n4.  build projects that solve real-world problems that you are genuinely passionate about. \n5.  find a mentor whom you aspire to be, as soon as possible (it can be life-changing)\n6.  document your learning journey and share them on Linkedin (it costs $0).\n7.  stay consistent and disciplined with your learning schedule. (join an accountability group) \n8.  apply your skills through freelancing, internships, or by contributing to open-source early on. \n9.  be patient and persistent, breaking into data takes time and effort.\n\n\nRemember, \nConsistency beats intensity. \n\nSo take time to breathe and enjoy the learning process. \n\n\n#breakintodata #datascience #ml",

You need to identify at least 2-3 areas from your technical expertise within Data Science. Either from your previous job or personal projects. \n\nIt can be: \n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Forecasting \n\u2b50\ufe0f Recommended systems \n\u2b50\ufe0f Computer vision \n\u2b50\ufe0f Etc\u2026\n\nBased on those, build your main 3 resumes that focus on each methodology with in-depth bulletin points and metrics. \n\nSo next time you will apply for a DS role you will pick one of the 3 instead of creating one from scratch. \n\nThis will keep you focused and show potential employers that you are indeed knowledgeable in your focus area. \n\nIf you want to watch the entire episode with Karun. \nSubscribe to our YouTube channel and turn on the notifications \ud83d\udc47 \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gNCY3SDi",

Job security.\nWhile companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google laid off over 240,000 tech workers in 2023, the demand for ML professionals remained robust. This is largely due to the ongoing innovation in AI and ML.\n\n2. Higher demand = Higher pay:\nML engineers make 15-20% higher salaries than other data roles, with staff MLe's at Google earning $600,000+. Deep learning specialists make even more.\n\n3. Diverse opportunities.\nOver 80% of the entire industry including healthcare, finance, entertainment, and supply chain desperately need ML talent to leverage their data and cloud resources and build revenue-driving algorithms.\n\n4. New engineering frontiers.\nThe rise of LLMs and GenAI created a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. But it comes with new non-deterministic challenges. Those who can make models more reliable and deterministic will become invaluable.\n\n5. Higher Ceiling for Growth.\nIt is impossible to hit the learning plateau in ML.\u00a0Weekly breakthroughs in research, models, and startups keep the field exciting. It is one of the most dynamic and rewarding fields in data.\n\n\nWhy do you choose machine learning?\n\n#machinelearning #ai",

        "content": "How Akanksha Paliwal got interview callbacks from Amazon, Square, Walmart & more, and landed a dream Data Science job in 6 months? \n\nYesterday, we invited her to speak at Break Into Data to share her job search strategy and learn from her mistakes. \n\nHere is what she\u2019s changed to finally start landing\u00a0interviews: \n\n1. CV: She stopped tailoring her resume for each job opening.\u00a0Instead, she created only 2 for Data Science and Data Analytics. On top of that she reached out to at least 10 highly experienced professionals, for feedback on her resume. This paid off immensely and she finally started getting callbacks. \n\n2. Change of environment: Prior to the job search her circle was made of computer science graduates, but she didn\u2019t know anyone who worked as a data scientist. This was not helping her job search. So she started making friends with data professionals through forums and data communities.  \n\n3. Cold Outreach with Emails: Instead of random LinkedIn DMs, she focused on finding emails of hiring managers and sent out highly customized and relevant inquiries, explaining how she could be a great fit for the role. \n\n4. Selective Projects: Instead of putting small Kaggle projects on her resume, she became a lot more strategic with her time. And chose to work on a real-world project from a startup that challenged her and aligned with her career goals in data science. \n\n5. Applying: Her daily goal was to apply to 10-15 positions through Linkedin and Company websites and track it on Excel. She also automated her cold outreach\u00a0with one email template that contained her background details. This way she focused more on finding relevant positions rather than crafting a unique message each time. \n\n\nIf you want to learn more than watch the entire episode on Youtube, find the link in the comments. \n\n#datascience #jobsearch",

If you were traumatized by math in school, just like me. Start with this beloved playlist - \u201cEssence of Linear Algebra\u201d - https://lnkd.in/g4Ket7PG - Trust me.

If you are practical learner, checkout fast.ai\u2019s course on - \u201cComputational Linear Algebra\u201d - https://lnkd.in/gY4N_WQC - You will finally learn how to apply LA on ML. \n\n3. If you see the world through the lense of traditional programming, checkout Weights & Biases fantastic - \u201cMath for Machine Learning\u201d course -  https://lnkd.in/gQ5dAPuH - You will start to see matrices as programming functions! \n\n\nBy the end of this, you will not only understand fundamentals of ML, but you will be able to build your own models and algorithms from scratch, if you wanted to. \ud83e\udd2f\n\n\nAnd remember, just like Andrej Karpathy suggests, focus on building intuition instead of memorization. \n\n\nAnd don\u2019t give up on math just yet!",

        "content": "It is surprising how many people don't understand the differences between ML engineering levels in Big Tech. It is a lot simpler than you think. \n\nImagine the task is to build a house.\n\n- The junior engineer gets a detailed blueprint with every instruction. They follow the steps carefully and successfully build the house, brick by brick.\n\n- The mid-level engineer receives only half of the blueprint. They can still fill in the gaps with their past experience and problem-solving skills, and complete the house on time. \n\n- The senior engineer doesn't get a blueprint, because the last engineer burned it. Instead, they research zoning laws, survey the land, to create the blueprint from scratch, and lead the team until the house is built.\n\n- The staff engineer questions why we\u2019re even building the house in the first place. After speaking with stakeholders, they realized an apartment building is needed instead. They convince the team to pivot and complete a better project, making more money instead.\n\n- The principal engineer is in panic. They don't think we should use bricks at all. They design a modular system that allows us to build anything we want faster and cheaper, setting the foundation for future projects.\n\n- The distinguished engineer is done with physical buildings. They create virtual homes in the metaverse, so we can be anywhere and everywhere all at once. \n\n\nEvery time you level up, you change your mindset and your behaviors, from pure execution to strategic and critical thinking. \n\nIf you're aiming for the next level, focus on mindset shifts with an unprecedented innovative approach that challenges the status quo. \n\n\nP.S. this is relevant to all engineering roles, and not just ML. \n\n#machinelearning #career",

Build your confidence as a learner first! Get those small wins early on and only then increase the complexity. \n\n- Watch out for new emerging roles in data at the intersection of Cloud, AI, and Software Engineering that require a new non-deterministic way of thinking, compared to traditional deterministic engineering. \n\n\nMy favorite quote was: \n\n\n\"There\u2019s a huge opportunity, especially for new people, to skip a step and immediately start learning how to write code with AI tools and land new roles that never existed before!\n\nMost people can do it!\n\nIt's about believing in yourself and getting it done.\"\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nWhat do you think about his advice? \n\n\n#breakintodata #bid",

        "content": "A friend recently shared how he learned to develop and deploy ML algorithms, and it completely changed my approach to learning.\nI now wish this method was prioritized over using common ML libraries.\n\nFor example, we dive headfirst into scikit-learn, calling model. fit() completely bypassing the crucial step of understanding the model's inner workings.\n\nThis robs us of independent thinking and creativity as we try to become a better engineer. \n\nHowever, after applying this first-principle thinking to my learning process, I became more confident, and able to learn much faster.\n\nHere is how: \n\n1. Start with the Problem:\n\nIdentify the core problem you want to solve with an algorithm. Instead of focusing on how others have solved it, ask questions like:\n\n- what is the nature of the data? \n- what classes and relationships are we trying to uncover?\n- what parameters should we take into account? \n\n2. Understand the Underlying Principles:\n\nDive into the mathematical and statistical foundations of the algorithm you are building. \n\nFor instance:\n- is it an optimization problem? finding the best parameters to minimize or maximize a function\n- is it a probability question? modeling uncertainty and make predictions\n- is it a causal inferencing? defining cause-and-effect relationships between variables\n\n3. Rebuild from Scratch:\n\nImplement algorithms from the ground up with Python only, focusing on the core logic.\n\nBy doing this, you\u2019re forced to confront the complexities that are often abstracted away.\n\n4. Compare it: \n\n with the source code of any corresponding popular ML library and you will gain a much deeper appreciation and understanding of that technology!\n\n...\n\nI am curious to know what is your favorite way of learning ML?",

        "content": "How to Design a Database Schema for Ride-Sharing Apps during a 30 min Interviews.\n\nIf you're prepping for a tech interview, understanding how to design database schemas, especially for dynamic apps like Uber or Lyft, is crucial. \n\n\nHere's a short guide based on a Jay Feng's interview prep video:\n\n\n\ud835\udc14\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2a\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d: First, clarify if the schema is for analytics, backend, or app service. Optimization for latency is key, especially for backend services.\n\n\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc03\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c: Design separate tables for different functionalities - one optimized for latency (real-time app interactions) and another for analytics and machine learning.\n\n\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc0a\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c: Start with immutable attributes like 'trip ID' and 'event timestamp'. In NoSQL databases (like DynamoDB), these form the unique keys.\n\n\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c: Include critical attributes like rider ID, driver ID, location coordinates, and ratings. Avoid unnecessary joins in NoSQL; include essential paired attributes in the same table.\n\n\ud835\udc07\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2c: For low-latency systems, use NoSQL databases.

(only 20% of everyone I talked with)\n\nHaving spent most of my adult life in the Bay Area, I've grown accustomed to new AI inventions seamlessly becoming part of my daily routine.\n\nIt just shows how naturally people in San Francisco adapt to innovation.\n\nBut back home in Kyrgyzstan, I was surprised to see very little enthusiasm for AI in the general public. \n\nWhen I saw my grandparents, I didn't even think to bring up ChatGPT...\n\nUntil they asked me to write a song in Kyrgyz for their upcoming 60th anniversary.\n\nThat\u2019s when it hit me: \u201cHave you heard of a 'genius computer' that knows everything?\u201d I asked.\n\nThey thought I was joking. \n\nSo, I quickly opened my laptop, gave ChatGPT family details, and asked it to create a song in Kyrgyz. (To my relief, it didn't hallucinate much \ud83d\ude05 )\n\nThe result? \n\nGrandpa was completely shocked and couldn't get away from the computer for another hour. \n\nand Grandma got deeply confused and even a little scared. \n\nNow, it seems they might just need a subscription of their own.\n\nIn general,  I believe it's important to bring all generations on board and show them how AI can make a real difference in their everyday lives!",

MLE uses Python and sometimes Rust, C++, and Java. \n\nSome similarities:\n\n- Both, DS and MLE need to follow version control, documentation, and reproducibility standards. \n- Both, DS and MLE need a strong understanding of statistics, machine learning algorithms, and their applications.\n- Both work closely with data engineers to ensure data quality and availability.\n- Both hate unnecessary meetings.\n- Both need to balance model complexity with constraints like computational resources and interoperability.\n\nRemember, in many organizations, the lines between these roles can blur. \n\nThe key is to find where your personal skills and interests align best. \n\n...\n\nWhat else would you add?",

You can do it only if you understand their current problem and their business well. \n\nHere is how you can do it:\n\n1. Interviewer: Provides you with a context and a current business goal/problem. \n2. You: Instead of answering right away, pause and ask clarifying questions.\n3. Interviewer: Provides more context.\n4. You: Repeat what you understood, pause, and think, and then respond. (Feel free to ask  more clarifying questions if necessary)\n5. Interviewer: Asks more follow-up questions.\n6. You: Provide more value and ask them for feedback to adjust your answer further. \n\n\u267b\ufe0fWash. Rinse. Repeat. \n\nIf you want to outcompete other applicants, act like a salesman, and show your genuine interest and true competence to win their trust. \n\nGood luck! \n\n#mlengineer #interview #bid",

I thought I was cool and dedicated. \n\nBut it was one of the stupidest things I have ever done.\n\nI was brainwashed by the SF tech culture, that success meant constant grinding with no breaks, \n\nOtherwise.... you are a loser. \n\nI learned the hard way how toxic it was, because ultimately: \n\n- our brain needs rest to learn effectively. \nAfter a few of those late nights, my ability to absorb new information crashed. \nIf you won't prioritize sleep, it will only get worse. \n\n- the tech world will always demand more. \nThere's always another algorithm to master, another mountain to climb. If you don't set boundaries, the work will consume you.\n\n- your health is your most valuable asset. \nThe headaches, eye strain, and back pain from that night took a while to fully recover from. No KPI is worth that.\n\n- balance makes you a better performer and a leader. \nWhen I'm well-rested and balanced, I can provide much better support and guidance.\n\nEven if a project fails, or you get laid off, you can (and will) recover.\nBut your health and relationships are much harder to repair once damaged.\n\nNow,  I remind myself:\n\n- set realistic deadlines that don't require heroic efforts\n- prioritize sleep and exercise\u2014they're as important as coding practice\n- take regular breaks to step away from the screen\n- remember that consistency trumps intensity\n\nYour dedication is admirable, but if you want a long-lasting career you need to prioritize work-life balance. \n\nRemember, the best leaders aren't those who work the longest hours, but those who sustain their energy and enthusiasm in the long run.",

You already have a solid foundation that is directly applicable to ml engineering. \n\nThis includes:\n\n- Strong programming skills that many data scientists lack\n- Understanding the software development lifecycle \n- Familiarity with version control like Git \n- Fundamentals of System Design. \n\nOnce you've got a baseline, then you just need to:\n\n- Build a strong understanding of linear algebra and statistics behind machine learning models. You can follow this guide - https://lnkd.in/gSfpKWBQ\n\n- Learn about core machine learning concepts and algorithms. You can start here  - https://lnkd.in/ggusYiX8\n\n- Practice building, training, and deploying machine learning models. Check out this Krish Naik's ML Deployment playlist - https://lnkd.in/gTpSDEZa\n\n- Read up on machine learning papers. I like to learn from Yannic Kilcher's simple explanations of popular research papers  - https://lnkd.in/gyUipbv7\n\n- Seek out machine learning projects within your current company to gain hands-on experience. \n\n- Start interviewing for machine learning engineer roles!\n\n...\n\nIf you are ready to make progress, join our community on Discord - https://lnkd.in/g5kpXwRM",

Knowing this will help you choose the right option.\n\n2. \ud835\udc02\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc32\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c: Shared hosting (When you share one server with others), Dedicated hosting (When you own the entire server), VPS hosting( Provides features of dedicated hosting but at a lower cost)\n\n3. \ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc1a \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1e. If this is your first time hosting on a cloud I would recommend VPS, as it has the best of two worlds. I personally moved from Heroku to VPS hosting on https://lnkd.in/d3qcNA6r for my projects, it was easier to set up, had a lower cost, high security, and automated data backup.\n\n4. \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc29. Once you've chosen your provider and plan, set up your virtual server. This involves configuring the operating system, setting up the network, and securing your server.\n\n5. \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc32\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27. Transfer your data, set up databases, and configure any necessary software and credentials on the dashboard. \n\n6. \ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b. With everything in place, continually monitor your application's performance. A good VPS provider will offer compliance indicators for service performance and uptime.\n\nLaunching your data project on a VPS ensures you have a scalable environment, which is more cost-effective for smaller applications and yet it provides high availability and performance.\n\n\nHappy coding and deploying!\n\n\nP.S.

Trust comes first. \n\n2. evaluation: Due to the non-deterministic nature of AI, robust and reliable evaluation methods are not only challenging to build but also absolutely critical. \n\n3.  agentic AI: The shift towards proactive AI systems will bring the next wave of GenAI applications that fully leverage its automation potential. \n\n4. multimodal: There's a growing trend towards integrating multiple data types -text, images, and audio - to build more human-like experiences with AI. \n\n5. data literacy: Despite the rapid advancement of AI, there is still a huge skill gap in the industry.  It is better to have 100s of educated data professionals (data science citizens) than to have a few AI/ML unicorns. \n\n...\n\nWhat trends are you most excited about?",

They often spent nights and weekends on online courses, research papers, and side projects. This genuine enthusiasm helped them push through initial rejections and self-doubts, where many people fail. \n\n2. \ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc04\ud835\udc31\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc2c: They built upon their prior experience in domains like software engineering and data analysis to transition into AI/ML roles.

Making friends will take time, be patient.\n2. Take leadership roles in your favorite clubs to gain experience outside of the classroom. \n3. Find a professional therapist and commit to it for at least 6 months. (can't stress this enough)\n4. Get diagnosed with ADHD asap. Everything will start to make sense. \n5. Take advantage of Career Services at school. (use everything they give)\n6. Start weight lifting and long-distance running. (it will boost your self-esteem)\n7. Surround yourself with those who inspire you, and don't be afraid to leave the ones who don't.\n8. Network with alumni and find a mentor early on. (life-changing)\n9. Learn SQL and Python and build your portfolio. (trust me, you will get a job)\n10. Quit trying to fit in and don\u2019t be afraid to stand out. (you deserve it)\n\n\nWhat would you tell your 18-year-old self? \n\n\nP.S. This is me on our first day of college in 2014.",

Industry vs Research. \nDo you want to build products or explore new ideas?\nThe industry offers higher pay but less freedom, focusing on products. Research prioritizes innovation over profits.\n\n2. Startups vs Big Tech\nDo you want speed and risk, or stability and structure?\nStartups move fast, reward risk, and need generalists. Big Tech offers stability, specialized roles, and more resources.\n\n3. Vertical vs Horizontal. \nDo you want to serve customers or engineers?\nVertical markets focus on specific industries (healthcare, finance), requiring domain expertise. Horizontal markets offer tools for engineers across industries.\n\n4. Consumer vs Enterprise\nDo you want to focus on users or enterprises?\nB2C builds products for users. B2B creates solutions for businesses.\n\n...\n\nOnce you answer these questions, you will have a better understanding of your long-term career preferences. \n\nDo this often, as preferences may change!\n\n\ud83d\udd14 If you like this, sign up for Break Into Data's newsletter and get weekly career guidance, free resources, and more: https://lnkd.in/gmmWf7uE \n\n\u267b Repost to help others find it.",

        "content": "Large context windows will NOT replace RAG.\nHere is why. \ud83d\udc47\n\nSo many people believe that, as foundation models expand their large context windows (LCW), RAG will become obsolete. This is a common misconception that overlooks the unique benefits of RAG such as: \n\n1. \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc05\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20: A large context window might process a lot of data, but it doesn't inherently filter for relevance. RAG retrieves only the most relevant documents from a database, ensuring the query has the most useful context. \n\n2. \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc04\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc32: Loading entire datasets into a model's context window is impractical and expensive, especially when dealing with real-time, dynamic content. RAG's structure lets you store and retrieve vast knowledge bases on demand, using only what's necessary to answer a query. \n\n3. \ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c: Even the largest context windows are finite and can quickly be overwhelmed by extensive data sources. RAG sidesteps this by retrieving just the right context at each step, ensuring that even smaller models with limited memory can access a nearly limitless knowledge base.\n\n4. \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc04\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc32: Extending context length comes at a cost. Each additional token in a model\u2019s input requires more processing power, increases latency, and drives up expenses. RAG is more efficient by using fewer tokens overall, focusing only on the most pertinent data, and reducing computational costs without compromising performance.\n\n...\n\nWhile LCWs allow models to process more information in a single prompt, they don\u2019t solve the challenges of efficiency, relevance, or scalability that RAG does so well!\n\nKeep that in mind when developing AI-driven applications. \n\n...\n\nIf you want to learn more about building a RAG system, check out my new course on RAG with Langchain on the DataCamp's platform!\n\n\nYou can start the first chapter for free here, once you register.\u00a0 - https://lnkd.in/gnGXMkTe\n\n\n#AIengineering",

        "content": "I used to be ashamed of how my ADHD brain worked. \n\"You never finish what you start, Meri!\" \nI was told so often it became part of my identity. \n\nBack then I did not even know what ADHD was. \n\nIn my late teens, I started noticing how fast I would pick up a new skillset.\n\nIt would take only 3-4 months to learn a local language whenever I moved. Like Chinese and German. While some of my friends would take years. \n\n\nHowever, I would dissociate a lot during classes and get kicked out for being a class clown.\nI knew I had \"a little bit\" more of chaotic energy in me than in others.\n\n\nI also had a hard time focusing on \"boring\" things. Like Excel. \nI thought, my brain was just slow or weird. \n\n\nFinally, after numerous nudges from friends earlier this year, \nI made an appointment with a psychiatrist and got officially diagnosed with \"extreme case of ADHD\" at the age of 27. \n\n\nTo say it changed my life is to say the least.\nNow I understand my behaviors without underlying shame or judgement for being different. \n\n\nMy self-esteem has improved significantly since then. \n\n\nI now prioritize understanding my brain's natural inclinations instead of forcing it to be \"normal\".\n\n\nTo give you an idea. \n\n\nNowadays, I allow myself to engage in at least 3 of these activities at any given day: \n\n- Building Python Bots \n- Analyzing Personal Data\n- Brainstorming content ideas\n- Taking Data Science course\n- Writing content\n- Creating a video for IG or Tikok\n\n\nThe ADHD brain thrives on curiosity and novelty! \nSeeking variety in your work will make you feel more fulfilled and successful. Reducing the boredom friction is critical for job satisfaction.\n\n----\n\n\nWhat hobby projects are you working on to satisfy your brain itch?\n\n#adhd #adhdbrain #mentalhealth",

        "content": "ChatGPT exploded to 100 million monthly active users within 60 days of its launch. That led to 5 unprecedented engineering challenges. \nHere is how they solved them to continue scaling. \n\n\n1.  Balance of Memory and Computing Power\nChallenge: The \"self-attention\" mechanism in ChatGPT meant computational demands grew quadratically as conversations got longer.\nSolution: The team implemented a sophisticated \"Key Value cache\" system to store previous computations in the limited GPU memory, reducing the need for recomputation.\n\n2. Optimizing for Arithmetic Intensity\u00a0\nChallenge: Ensuring the GPUs were being used as efficiently as possible, balancing compute power and memory bandwidth.\nSolution: The team carefully tuned the \"batch size\" - the number of requests processed at once - to maximize the ratio of floating-point operations to data movement.\n\n3. Finding the Right Metrics\nChallenge: Traditional performance metrics didn't provide the necessary visibility into the system's bottlenecks.\nSolution: The team developed new monitoring approaches, focusing on KV cache utilization and cache miss rates, to identify and address the unique challenges of large language models.\n\n4. GPU Scarcity\nChallenge: The powerful NVIDIA GPUs needed were in incredibly short supply.\nSolution: The team sourced these critical hardware components from a global network of cloud providers, managing a distributed and heterogeneous GPU fleet.\n\n5. Limits to Growth\nChallenge: Ultimately, there was only so much hardware available to scale the system.\nSolution: The team had to carefully manage capacity and, at times, restrict access to ensure the system remained available and responsive for users.\n\n...\n\nIt is pretty cool to see the behind-the-scenes of this historical engineering moment. \n\n\nIf you want to read more about it, check out Gergely Orosz's article on \"Scaling ChatGPT: Five Real-World Engineering Challenges\". \n\n.",

        "content": "Yesterday, we talked about the positive effects of consistent learning. \ud83e\udde0 \nBut do you know what has the most impact on our cognitive functions? \nIt is our often forgotten - nervous system! \n\nYour efficiency as a learner  largely depends on your day-to-day neurological condition. \n\nWhat does this all mean? \n\n\nAccording to a Polyvagal Theory, our bodies operate in 1 of 3 nervous system states:\n\n\n- Ventral Vagal State: This is a state of safety, marked by calmness, joy, and a sense of connection. It supports better digestion, immune response. \n\nFor example. You are in this state, when writing code, analyzing data, reading or socializing with colleagues during lunch. \n\n\n\n- Sympathetic State: Known as the fight or flight response, it's associated with feelings of anxiety, agitation, or heightened energy.\u00a0\nThis state leads to increased blood pressure, heart rate, and adrenaline, but hampers digestion. \n\nFor example, you experience this when working on urgent project deadlines or responding to emergencies during on-call duties.\n\n\n\n- Dorsal Vagal State:This shutdown response is linked with feelings of dissociation, helplessness, or depression, conserving energy and increasing the pain threshold. It often occurs after burnout or as a response to trauma.\n\nFor example, you might feel this way after months of strenuous work that did not lead to any results.\u00a0\nIt can also be a common response to a childhood trauma or burnout in adulthood. \n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, many people live in a dorsal vagal state mistaking it for laziness or general apathy. \n\nOr in the sympathetic state, constantly stressed out and on the edge, thinking it helps them move them forward. \n\n\nAs adults, we often forget that neither of these states is necessary for leading ambitious careers and fulfilling lives.\nIn fact, the opposite is true. Being in the Ventral Vagal State allows us to:\n\n- Process and retain information more effectively.\n- Recover and restore efficiently from physical and mental strains.\n- Be more present and engaged with the important people in our lives.\n\n\nSimply put, the more time you spend in Ventral Vagal State the more sustainable progress you can make. \n\nI am writing this in hopes of encouraging self-awareness and self-regulation as a continuous form of self care. \n\nThis approach will not only enhance your own life but also massively impact those around you. \n\nRemember your well-being is our well-being!\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\nWhat do you do daily to regulate your own nervous system? \n\n#mentalhealth #neuroscience",

And now we know that at least 10% of all Data Analysts and 40% of all CDOs in the USA have a Tesla Truck.\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem, we calculate,\nP(H\u2223E), the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence:\n\n\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3b\u2223\ud835\udc38) = \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3b)\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc38\u2223\ud835\udc3b)  /  P(E\u2223H)\u00d7P(H)+P(E\u2223\u00acH)\u00d7P(\u00acH)\n\nin short... \n\n\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3b\u2223\ud835\udc38) = \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3b)\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc38\u2223\ud835\udc3b) / \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc38)\n\nIn this case:\n\n\u25aa H represents the hypothesis that the person is the Chief Data Officer (CDO).\n\n\u25aa E represents the total probability of the evidence that the person has a Tesla truck.\n\nFrom the image, you can see that the answer is 16.67% which means: \n\nIt is 16.67% likely that the truck belongs to CDO. \n\nWhich means we should probably not bother her first.  \ud83d\ude1d \n\n\nP.S. I loved making these. \nLet me know if it helps in the comments \u2764\ufe0f \n\n\n\u200b \u267b Share with your network. \n\ud83d\udcf2 Follow for more content like this. \n\n\n#breakintodata #bid",

Here is my answer \ud83d\udc47\n\n\nI\u2019d encourage these 10 destructive habits: \n\n1. I would instill the idea that only \"geniuses\" have access to this field. \n\n2. I would tell them to endlessly study theory without applying knowledge practically.\n\n3. I would encourage beginners to compare themselves to experts every day. \n\n4. I would exaggerate the complexity of the field and let the confusing math notations stop from learning.\n\n5. I would discourage participating in communities and collaborative projects, depriving people of crucial support and opportunities.\n\n6. I would create endless distractions, like shiny new AI tools and libraries, that make people forget about fundamentals.\n\n7. I would downplay the importance of communication skills and teamwork. \n\n8. I would let them believe that failure is bad and should be avoided at all costs. \n\n9. I would let them believe skills are fixed and can never be developed. \n\n10. I would nurture self-doubt every time they make a minor mistake leading to imposter syndrome. \n\n...\n\nNow, ask yourself\u2014are any of these habits secretly holding you back? \n\nRecognizing these habits is the first step to building a healthier mindset that brings you closer to your best and most authentic life.\n\n\n#mindset",

        "content": "Have you ever wondered who is behind the largest open-source frameworks?\nAnd why should you even care? \n\nMany tools that we use daily were once born out of the frustrations of ordinary engineers, like you and me, who eventually decided to build better solutions and later revolutionized the entire industry. \n\nHere are some origin stories: \n\n- Apache Spark: Matei Zaharia and his team at UC Berkeley didn\u2019t like the limitations of a linear dataflow structure of MapReduce, so they built Spark in 2009. The framework introduced\u00a0Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) which for the first time allowed in-memory processing for large-scale analytics.\u00a0Today, it is used by 80% of Fortune 500 companies. \n\nFun Fact. The logo represents its speed. \n\n- Apache Kafka: LinkedIn engineers Jay Kreps, Neha Narkhede, and Jun Rao were struggling with real-time data integration across their growing ecosystem of applications. In 2011, Kafka solved this by creating a distributed streaming platform capable of handling high-throughput, fault-tolerant pub/sub messaging.\u00a0Today it is used by 100,000 organizations worldwide. \n\nFun fact: Kafka is named after the author Franz Kafka, and its partitioned log model was inspired by Kafka's writing style.\n\n- Apache Airflow: Maxime Beauchemin at Airbnb needed a way to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor complex data workflows. Airflow solved this in 2014 by providing a platform to create directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of tasks, with rich scheduling and dependency management features.\u00a0Today it is a Top data orchestration tool.\n\nFun fact: Airflow's mascot is a blue squirrel named \"Squeaky,\" chosen because squirrels are known for their ability to plan and execute complex tasks.\n\n\u2026\n\nMany do not know this, but the majority of private companies make their profits by leveraging these giant open-source frameworks. \n\nIf you work at a large company that doesn\u2019t contribute to open source, it probably doesn't want to attract the best engineering talent.\n\nTime to make them contribute. \n\n\n#opensource",

Gather data on skills listed in job postings. Skills might include Python, SQL, machine learning, etc.\n2. Take random samples of 30 job postings at a time. For each sample, count the frequency of each skill.\n3. Calculate the average number of times each skill appears in these samples.\n\nFor ex. if you find that Python appears an average of 25 times with a standard deviation of 3 in your samples, you can infer that Python is highly sought after. If the sample mean for SQL is 5, then maybe you should stop focusing on it. \n\nOf course, this is a general take on the CLT and there are many more techniques to measure the validity of your hypothesis, like: \n\n- \ud835\udc2d-\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d: Used to compare the means of two groups and determine if they are significantly different from each other.\n- \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc15\ud835\udc00 (Analysis of Variance): Extends the t-test to more than two groups, testing for differences in means across multiple groups.\n\n\nIf you find this post helpful...\n\n\ud83d\udc4d React\n\u267b\ufe0f Share\n\ud83d\udcac Comment\n\nSo more people can learn with simple explanations \ud83d\udc47\n\n#datascience #statistics #jobsearch",

        "content": "Stop wasting time and start building your ML portfolio like a pro. \nIf you're struggling to land interviews, you might be making these crucial mistakes.\n\nI wish I heard these tips when I was just starting out. \n\nThey would have saved me a lot of time and provided clarity on building a solid portfolio.\n\nFollow them here: \n\n1. Focus on quality over quantity. Instead of having 16 random Github repos, reduce it to 2-3 projects that align with each domain of your choice. \n\n2. Avoid using CSV files as a data source. I taught you better than that. There are hundreds of open APIs you should use.\n\n3. Maintain a learning document for each project. Write down the challenges you faced while building the project and how you overcame them. This will truly set you apart during the interviews.\n\n4. Once you finish the first version of an ML project, don't rush to start a new one. Instead, think about how you would deploy it with real-world constraints and industry demands. \n\n5. Be creative when sharing your project on Linkedin. Pro tip: Try to grasp attention in the first 1-2 sentences. I spend 80% of my time writing hooks on my post. Don't believe me? Go to my account and check all of my posts. \n\n...\n\nIf you'd like to learn more on this subject, check out my article - https://lnkd.in/gMedw2i6 \n\n....\n\nWe will be launching hands-on ML workshops with Break Into Data this month. \n\nLet us know in the comments what do you want to build next? \n \n\n#ml #interview #breakintodata",

        "content": "Did you know that Large Language Models (LLMs) can handle more than just text and code?\nHere is how LLMs are changing the Robotics field. \n\nYesterday, Jason Ma, presented his research paper, Eureka, where he leverages LLMs to improve Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques in robotics. \n\nI was intrigued by the presentation because it was relevant to my previous work. I also struggled with training a robotic arm to perform with precision. \n\nHowever, I never got a chance to work with the Reinforcement Learning (RL) model, which is a widely popular approach in autonomous driving that became popular after AlphaGo defeated a professional human player. \n\nBut, Jason decided to take one step further and introduce LLMs to RL to tackle this tedious problem. \n\nIn his paper, he uses language models to write reward functions at scale which are fed back to the RL model to help robots perform complex tasks, such as balancing on top of\u00a0a yoga ball. See the video. \n\nHow did he achieve it? \n\nImagine this...\n\nThe probability of a robot landing in the right target pose can be 20% in one possible scenario. But if we use LLMs to generate 16 more ways to arrive at that pose, we have a significantly better probability, increasing the success rate to over 90%. \n\nTypically, designing these reward functions is manually intensive and relies heavily on domain expertise and trial-and-error adjustments.\n\nThe cool thing about Eureka is that the system can generate reward functions for previously unseen tasks by leveraging LLMs, and do it at scale. \n\nThank you Jay Yao, Peter Danenberg and Justin Woo for organizing these events and introducing great research!\n\nIf you are a tinkerer...\n\n\ud83d\udd79\ufe0f You can run his code on a simulation here -> https://lnkd.in/gtJNtU2d \n\n\ud83c\udf0e  And If you have a  robot use this repo ->\u00a0https://lnkd.in/gn6AZPwc\n\n---\n\nSign up for our newsletter, where we discuss ML and Data  https://lnkd.in/gEMeG9GV",

        "content": "San Francisco gives me anxiety. \nEveryone is trying to board a 1.3 trillion dollar AI rocket ship. \nMeanwhile, I was preoccupied with self-doubt and only now waking up to it. \n\nYesterday, I had a hot debate with my talented friends about the current AI frenzy and how to be part of it. \nThey are successful Research Engineers and Managers at rapidly scaling AI startups. \nSo I wanted to ask them how to land an AI Research Engineering job that I'd love.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the advice they gave to me:\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \ud835\udc05\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20: View the GenAI field as a rocket ship; your primary objective is to simply GET ON BOARD. Don't focus on the role, compensation, and other perks.  Focus on getting your foot through the door. \n\n\ud83d\ude80 \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc29 \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c: Don't look at titles. Look at companies in general. Once you're in the door, build relationships with decision-makers and demonstrate your adaptability and eagerness to learn; you can always pivot to your desired position within the company. \n\n\ud83d\ude80 \ud835\udc04\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c: After our conversation, I  realized I was focusing on whether the rocket ship will like me or whether I am good enough for it. Which now sounds hilarious to me. \ud83d\ude06 Become conscious of these self-deprecating thoughts. They cloud your vision so much so that you will stop seeing endless opportunities around you. \n\n\nRegularly get out of your own head and change your perspective. \nSee your dream job as an opportunity to seize and a goal to chase. \nBe ready to face various challenges to achieve it. \n\n\n---\nRemember, \n\nIt is not about you. \n\nIt is about the prize. \n\n---\n\nHow do you get out of your own way? \n\n\n#breakintodata #bid #datascience #ai #llm",

        "content": "Consistent learning changes your brain through neuroplasticity. \n\nIt\u2019s an easy buzzword to throw around. But few actually know what happens when you leverage it.\n\nThis is how your brain transforms when you consistently learn something for 30 days : \n\nIt will become sharper \u26a1\ufe0f\n\n- Myelination: Consistent learning develops the fatty layer called myelin around your brain neurons. This in turn speeds up the transmission of electrical signals in the brain. Which helps you use your practiced skills more efficiently. \n\nIt will become faster \ud83d\udca8\n\n- Improved attention and concentration: with each repetition you lessen the initial friction to get into \u201cthe deep focus zone\u201d. Which means over time you will become even a faster learner! \n\nYou\u2019ll become more confident \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc\n\n- Cognitive and behavioral changes: Doing hard things and solving complex tasks daily, tells your brain that you have a higher capacity to accomplish things.  It has a dramatic positive influence in your motivation, persistence and resilience! \n\n\nIf there is a day with no learning, it is a a sad day.\n\n\nWhat skills are you working on these days?\n\n\n#growthmindset",

I am never able to complete any course, because\n there are always more innovative technologies to learn. This would lead me to start multiple roadmaps but not finish any. \n\n\u2614 There are more frequent burnouts due to overwhelm and ADHD paralysis.

To meet them, you need to plan well, coordinate with others, and sometimes make tough decisions between scope and quality. \n\n...\n\nYou could only learn this on the job. \n\nThat is why we decided to tackle this problem by...\n\nBuilding a first-ever AI manager for our Break Into Data's workshops. \n\nWe made it so she would act as any other human engineer would. \n\nDon't worry she is a good kind of manager...\n\nShe will \"only\": \n\n- Assign you tickets with detailed tasks.  \ud83d\udc49 Just like with Scrum boards.   \n- Message you daily to receive updates. \ud83d\udc49 Just like with Daily Standups.\n- Provide you with technical support.  \ud83d\udc49 Just like a tech lead would. \n\nAnd sometimes even give you compliments and praise. \u263a\ufe0f\n\nThis unique learning approach will not only teach you how to build cool projects but also prepare you for the corporate environment. \n\n\nAnd oh, be nice to her!

        "content": "Feature engineering is a critical aspect of building robust ML systems. There isn't one metric that directly measures its quality. However, if you master these 6 techniques you can ensure model's accuracy 80% of the time: \n\n\n1. Handling Missing Values:\n\n- Imputation: Replace missing values with the mean, median, or mode, or use predictive imputation. For instance, filling missing ages in a customer dataset with the median age.\n\n- Deletion: Remove rows or columns with too many missing values, but this risks losing important information, like removing a variable that\u2019s highly predictive but has 30% missing data.\n\n2. Scaling and Normalization:\n\n- Scaling: Normalize features to a standard range, such as [0, 1], to ensure equal contribution to the model. \n\n- Log Transformation: Apply to skewed data like income to stabilize variance and make patterns more discernible, e.g., log-transforming annual income to reduce skewness.\n\n3. Encoding Categorical Features:\n\n- One-Hot Encoding: Transform categorical variables into binary columns. Example: converting \"red,\" \"blue,\" \"green\" into three binary columns.\n\n- Hashing Trick: Efficiently handle high-cardinality categorical variables, useful in streaming applications where new categories frequently appear, like user IDs in web analytics.\n\n4. Feature Crossing:\n\n- Combining Features: Create new features by combining existing ones to capture interactions, such as combining 'age' and 'income' to create an 'age-income bracket' feature.\n\n5. Dealing with Temporal Data:\n\n- Temporal Features: Extract features like 'day of the week' or 'season' to capture temporal patterns. Example: 'day of the week' can significantly impact sales data analysis.\n\n6. Detecting and Avoiding Data Leakage:\n\n- Data Leakage: Prevent future data from influencing the training process, which can lead to overly optimistic performance metrics. For instance, using data from future events in training can mislead model accuracy.\n\n...\n\nMastering these feature engineering techniques is one of the things that separates good data scientists from great ones.\n\n\n#datascience #featureengineering",

I simply use ChatGPT to give me an outline and resources. There is no need to bother my senior engineer friends as much as I used to. \ud83d\ude05 \n\n\n2. \ud835\udc04\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc02\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c: There\u2019s an ever-growing community of learners and professionals in both fields. Platforms like Discord, GitHub, and various online forums are rich with resources, discussions, and collaborations, making it easier to get involved and stay updated with the latest tech.\n\n\n3. \ud835\udc06\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc30\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21 \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1f \ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1e : AI advancements have also been propelled by the open-source community. As a learner, you have the opportunity to contribute to or learn from real-world projects! Remember, hands-on experience is the most valuable asset you can showcase for future employers, partners and investors. \n\n\nDid you notice the difference in your learning rate recently?\n\n\n#datascience #breakintotech #dataanalytics #ai",

Every expert you admire once stood where you are now. Learn to accept challenges and frictions as part of the learning experience. \n\n2. \ud83d\udca1 \ud835\udc05\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc32: Instead of trying to learn everything at once, pick one area to focus on. Recognize that learning is a marathon, not a sprint. Understand your limits and avoid the urge to rush through materials or jump in-between subjects. Get back to clarity and simplicity each time you get overwhelmed. \n\n3. \ud83c\udfaf \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1c \ud835\udc04\ud835\udc31\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc18\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1f: Progress, no matter how small, is still progress. Know your limits. Set achievable daily, weekly, monthly targets and celebrate each milestone! This keeps motivation consistent and the journey more enjoyable.\n\n4. \ud83e\udd1d \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc24 \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2d: You're not alone. Reach out to mentors, join online communities, or partner with fellow learners. Shared experiences and guidance are invaluable. \n\n5. \ud83e\udd17 \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc02\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1e: Each evening, write down 5 things you are proud of achieving that day. Try to shoot for small wins. E.g., Solve 1 leetcode problem, push 1 git commit, write one Linkedin post, understand one concept,  etc. \n*This practice helps in recognizing your progress which is crucial in building self-confidence.\n\nRemember, the path from beginner to proficient is not just about acquiring skills; it's about personal growth and resilience. \nEmbrace the journey with patience and persistence, and watch as you transform challenges into stepping stones.\n\n\n--\n\n\nDo you get stuck or overwhelmed often?\n\n\n#softwareengineering #datascience #dataanalytics #ai #llm",

Stand out with your unique interest-driven projects instead.\n3. Don't focus too much on the tools and programming languages, focus on the problems and impact of your solutions. \n4. Keep track of your job application metrics, so you know what to improve at each stage. \n5. Know your shelf life, if you are not growing, leave. \n6. Always develop your quantitative skills. \n7. Do not take the current job market personally. Things will get better. \n8. Work on what you truly enjoy to succeed in the long run. \n9. Optimize your Linkedin for Keywords.\n10. If you can, have both, a therapist and a career coach.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed the list, follow these incredible Data Professionals, to learn more from their experiences: \n\n\ud83d\udd25 Maggie Wolff - Data Scientist at AMEX GBT\n\ud83d\udd25 Kelly Adams - Data Analyst at Golden Hearts Games\n\ud83d\udd25 Lindsay Murphy - Head of Data at Secoda\n\n\nWhat were your key takeaways from yesterday's panel? \n\n\n\n#breakintodata #bid #datascience #dataanalytics #ai",

The 3  emails are an educational email (Email A), a promotional offer (Email B), and a new product announcement (Email C). \n\nHow many different orders can Lucy test sending these emails?\n\nSolution using \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c:\nThere are 3 items (Email A, Email B, Email C), so the number of permutations is 3 factorial (3!), which is 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 6. The permutations are:\n\nEmail A \u2192 Email B \u2192 Email C\nEmail A \u2192 Email C \u2192 Email B\nEmail B \u2192 Email A \u2192 Email C\nEmail B \u2192 Email C \u2192 Email A\nEmail C \u2192 Email A \u2192 Email B\nEmail C \u2192 Email B \u2192 Email A\n\nEach order provides a unique sequence for sending the emails, which could lead to different levels of customer engagement.\n\n\ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc30 \ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d'\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc32\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc27. \n\nSolve this problem with \ud835\udc84\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc94. \n\nBesides testing the sequence, Lucy also wants to choose combinations of emails to send in a split-test campaign where not all subscribers receive all three emails. \n\nShe decides to test engagement when sending combinations of two emails out of these 3. \n\n\ud835\udc10: How many combinations of two emails can Lucy choose from?\n\n\n#probability",

Use LLM caching and content filtering for the final output for the user. \n\n\n3. Run\n\nAfter launching your app, you must establish evaluation metrics and continuously track them. \nInclude metrics on user engagement and user retention. \nThis will help you understand how the user interacts with your app. \n\nCheck out Jeffrey Ip Github repo(2k stars) to evaluate LLMS - https://lnkd.in/gwwdZVhB \n  \n\n\nAnd remember, start simple, you can always make your life harder later on. \n\n\nIf you want to practice...\n\nRegister for the End-to-End Live Session with Break Into Data\u2019s CTO\u00a0tomorrow at 10 AM Pacific time. \n\nSign up here - https://lnkd.in/gynhA7qy \n\n\n\u2014-\n\n\n\nAnd if you haven't already subscribe to the newsletter here - merinova.substack.com",

        "content": "Why do most ML projects fail? \nHere are 3 common mistakes that could be avoided...\n\n1. Lack of clear objectives. \n\nMany teams jump straight into ML without a clear understanding of the business problem and whether ML is even the right approach to begin with. To avoid this, gather clear product and software requirements specs from the beginning to avoid costly misunderstandings between you and the client down the line. \n\n2. Lack of traceability and reproducibility. \n\nAt our last event with Break Into Data, our speaker, Maria Vechtomova, an MLops Manager, explained the importance of reproducibility and observability in MLOps. Without these components, it becomes extremely difficult to scrutinize ML workflow, iterate on top of previous work, scale models to production, or ensure regulatory compliance. Make sure to set up that infrastructure early on. \n\n3. Poor assumptions on product usage.\n\nYesterday on our walk with Raja Ramana Kova, a Decision Scientist at Adobe, we discussed the importance of understanding user behavior. Instead of developing ML-driven features, focus first on analyzing data on users' activity. After serving your model, you may realize that the way users interact with your product is different from your initial assumptions, so you have to redo the entire project. To avoid this, make sure you have user behavior analytics data in place beforehand. \n\n\n---\n\n\n\nWhat are other mistakes you see? \n\n\n\n\n#ai #ml #datascience",

Read this post so you can build more efficient and scalable applications.\n\nHere is a cooking analogy to explain  'async' and 'await' functions.\n\nImagine you're preparing a grand feast. \ud83e\udd58 \n\nEach dish represents a task in your program. In traditional synchronous cooking (or programming), you'd prepare one dish at a time, which can be time-consuming and inefficient.\n\nLet's say you discovered asynchronous cooking and decided to try it out. \n\n\ud83d\udd39 Async Cooking: You start cooking a dish and move on to prep the next while the first one is still simmering. In programming, this is akin to starting a task and then awaiting its completion while you get on with something else. This is particularly handy when a task involves waiting (like fetching data or waiting for a user's input).\n\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73 Check out  a simple Python code snippet to illustrate this concept. \n\nEach dish is a task. \nUsing \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1c \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1f, we define an asynchronous function, cook_dish, which simulates cooking.\n\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc30\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28.\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc29(\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20_\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1e) mimics the dish cooking. Meanwhile, your program can do other tasks.\n\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28.\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b is your multitasking hero, handling multiple dishes at once.\n\n\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Asynchronous programming can be a game-changer, especially for I/O bound tasks. It's like having a smart kitchen where dishes almost cook themselves while you manage other tasks, making your programming kitchen a lot more productive.\n\n                                                                 \u27bf  \u27bf \u27bf  \n\n\n\ud83e\udd16 If you want to be more technical, look out for my next newsletter publication on:\n\nHow we are integrating LLM into our system with Discord API to increase \nengagement! \n\n\nIf you have not already, subscribe here \ud83d\udc49  https://lnkd.in/gEMeG9GV\n\n\n#softwaredevelopment #opensource #datascience",

Duration or time of falling asleep?\nMethods: EDA, Data Visualization, Correlation Coefficient, P value. \n\nResults: Shocking! Apparently there is not much correlation between amount of sleep and HRV. However, it is clear there is a relationships between the time of falling asleep and HRV. I want to continue figuring this out, I am not fully convinced yet.\n\n\nLet me know what else I could look into!\n\n\nP.S. Remember these findings and suggestions are not universal.

        "content": "How To Create Your First Product Development Roadmap in 6 Easy Steps?\nThis guide will help you save your team countless hours and unnecessary meetings. \n\nRecently, we welcomed 5 new developers and analysts to our Open Source Project, Break Into Data. \ud83d\ude0d \n\nIt became apparent that our only points of reference were the GitHub repository and our Discord channel, showing a clear need for a more centralized roadmap as our team of contributors is growing rapidly. \ud83c\udfaf \n\nSo we decided to consolidate everything into our Product Roadmap.  \ud83d\udcdc \n\nHere is how we approached it: \n\n1. \ud835\udc15\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc1e: Begin with a clear vision. What problem does your software solve? Who is it for? Define the scope to focus your efforts.\n\n2. \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc23\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c: Break your vision into achievable objectives. What are the critical milestones for your project? E.g., Establishing higher level system design, Deciding where to host your core infrastructure, etc. \n\n3. \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc33\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc05\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c: Identify and prioritize the features that are crucial for your MVP (Minimum Viable Product). Focus on what delivers the most value to your users. We identified 3 core features: Onboarding, LLM-driven submissions, and Personal & Global Analytics. \n\n4. \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c: Draft a realistic timeline. Outline the phases of development, from initial design to testing, and set deadlines for each phase. I like to refer to the Software Release Life Cycle. (SRLC)\n\n5. \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c: Clearly define team roles and responsibilities. Everyone needs to have a sense of ownership and accountability for the quality of their deliverables. \n\n6. \ud835\udc08\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc2d: Embrace agility. Regularly review your roadmap and be ready to adapt based on feedback and new insights. Have weekly meetings to go through the results of the past week and goals for the next. \n\n\n\nHow do you approach your product development life cycle? \n\n\n\nP.S.

What were my greatest accomplishments and most significant challenges this past year?\n\nReflect on the successes and challenges of the past year. Consider what you learned from both your achievements and your difficulties. This helps in understanding your growth areas and strengths.\n\n\n2. What did I learn about myself this year? \n*I personally love this one the most. \n\nThink about the insights you've gained about your values, desires, and areas for personal development. This reflection can guide your future goals and actions.\n\n\n3. What are my priorities and goals for the next year?\n\nBased on your reflections, set clear, achievable goals for the coming year. \nConsider how these goals align with your long-term vision for your life in the span of 3-5 years and what daily/weekly/monthly steps you need to take to accomplish them. \nDo not forget to establish your own metrics of how success looks like. \n\n\n\nWhen answering those questions, make sure to think in terms of the most important aspects of your life, such as:\n\n- Health\n- Personal Growth\n- Career or Professional Fulfillment\n- Relationships\n- Finances\n- Fun & Leisure \n\n---\n\n\nWhat did you learn about yourself this year?\n\n\n#newyear2024 #2024goals",

        "content": "This year I celebrated my first Christmas and it was not what I expected. \n\nAs a child, I always imagined it as a time when Santa Claus delivered neatly wrapped presents and everyone enjoyed sipping Eggnog. \n\nBack then, it seemed festive and foreign...\n\nBut, now that I experienced it first hand. \n\nIt brought back familiar memories of connection, kindness and generosity from my own upbringing.\n\nIn Central Asia, we have our own traditions, but the warmth and acceptance I felt during Christmas were universal. It made me think about how important it is to feel supported and valued, not just in our professional lives but also in our personal environments. Particularly when establishing your life in a different country.\n\nConnection and support from family and friends, much like a supportive workplace, significantly enhances our confidence and drive to succeed.\n\nTo those who are far from their families or are adapting to new traditions, remember that building a support system, whether through friends or colleagues, is crucial!\n\nEmbrace local holidays. \n\nNourish and celebrate new connections. \n\n\n----\n\n\n\nHow was your Christmas?",

        "content": "Avoid these 3 Common Mistakes When Job-Hopping with ADHD:\nEspecially if you want to avoid beginner's hell...\n\n1. Stop resisting your interest driven ADHD brain. \nAccept it as part of your identity, already. \n\n-Recognize that the cycle of hyperfocus and eventual burnout on new careers or hobbies is a common characteristic among individuals with ADHD.\n-It will lead to better strategic planning for career growth and personal development.\n-Remove guilt and shame associated with the cycle by embracing it as part of the unique way your brain is wired.\n\n\n2. Stop making hectic and impulsive decisions around Career and Hobby Transitions. \nLearn to take your time and reflect. \n\n- Before starting a new venture, evaluate the potential for growth and learning to ensure it will sustain your interest long-term.\n- Consider how much investment is required to enter a new field and what transferable skills you can bring to minimize starting from scratch.\n- Always be mindful of how skills acquired in one area can be applied to future ventures to create a continuous pathway of growth.\n\n\n3. Quit Underestimating Your Diverse Experiences and Skills. \n\n-Embrace the wealth of experience and diverse perspectives that come from frequently changing careers or hobbies.\n-Recognize that creativity and intelligence are strengths that can contribute to success in new and varied fields.\n-Be proactive in thinking about the next steps before reaching the point of burnout to ensure a smooth transition and application of accumulated skills.",

        "content": "Growing up in a high-context patriarchal culture \nmade me hyper vigilant about what I say. So I stayed QUIET.\n\"Youngsters and women do not get to speak up,\" we were often told. \n\nUnfortunately, I believed this narrative.  \nSo I thought to myself: \"I know I am smart already, so I better stay silent.\" \n\nI vividly remember, when my Neuroscience Professor at school,  Matt Johnson, PhD raised this issue with me. He asked why I was not engaging during classes, even though I always seemed well-prepared and appeared to enjoy them. It was a strange feedback for me back then.\n\nAll those years of staying quiet in every aspect of my life, led me to abandon my own opinions. It destroyed my confidence and allowed  an imposter syndrome develop inside. \n\nThis held me back from applying for positions that I was interested in and kept me isolated from valuable nurturing communities. \n\nBut everything changed when I realized I can not rely on others to NOTICE me. \n\nIt is up to me to speak up about my journey and share my insightful opinions, however absurd or controversial they may seem to me. \n\nThat is why I am excited to be posting here and on other social media platforms about mental health, gender equality, data science and entrepreneurship. \n\nI am grateful to have met people like Andy (Andreas) Kogelnik, MD, PhD, Matt Johnson, PhD, Sonam Gupta,  Zach Wilson who have been instrumental in empowering me to voice my opinions with confidence and in trusting my own abilities, especially in male dominated fields. \n\nEvery post I take a leap of courage and hope to make it a norm to stand up and stand out. Not only for me but also for many other young female professionals who are struggling to find and express their voice. \n\nWe got this :) \n\n#mentalhealth #impostersyndrome #femaleempowerment #femaleleadership #contentcreator #linkedincommunity #publicspeaking #confidencebuilding",

        "content": "Top 3 AI Opportunities mentioned at the 2024 World Economic Forum\n\nHere is a summary from the notable panel speakers: \n\n\nAndrew Ng -  Co-founder of Google Brain and developer of MOOCs in Deep Learning\nAidan Gomez - CEO at Cohere and a contributor to Transformer Architecture\nDaphne Koller -  Co-founder of Coursera who is celebrated for her groundbreaking work in applying machine learning to biomedical sciences\nYann LeCun - Chief AI Scientist at Meta Facebook and a founding father of convolutional neural networks, that made huge advancements in computer vision. \nKai-Fu Lee - a former president of Google China\n\n\nSo what should we be excited about? \n\n\n\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc03\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1a \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc31t: LLMs are great, but what about other types of data? The point that a four-year-old child, accumulates more data than current AI models trained on textual data, highlights the necessity for AI to evolve in processing non-textual data like images, videos and sounds. \nAs well as training AI to understand the concept of causality in the physical world, that can greatly broaden AI applications in the analog world. This means we have yet to come up with new ML Architectures for these instances. \n\n\n\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc05\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1f \ud835\udc04\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc08 \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2c: The panelists discussed the evolution of AI agents from simply responding to prompts to performing more complex and autonomous tasks. For example, the potential for AI agents to not only answer queries but also carry out actions like browsing web pages, conducting research, and compiling information autonomously. I am personally mostly excited about these opportunities. \n\n\n\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc08 \ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc2c: The panelist are encouraging the use of open-source AI to foster innovation and democratize access. Because this is the only way we can take advantage of current innovations. We do not want an imbalance where few large corporations end up holding the foundational access to the highly trained models and therefore powerful tools. Build on top of existing open source libraries and apply it in your field! \n\n\nThe future is here. \n\n\nTime to build. \n\n\n#datascience #breakintodata #ai #worldeconomicforum",

Unfortunately this perception is very common among ambitious high-achievers. As you see from section (a) ,it may not just be daunting, but also counterproductive.\n\nHowever, if you focus on building a robust support system first, before building your career or business, it will help you with :\n\n\t\t- Personal Development: Constructive feedback from your trusted network can help identify areas for improvement, fostering personal and professional growth.\n\n\t\t- Accountability: A support system can hold you accountable to your goals, increasing the chances of their achievement.\n\n\t\t- Resource Pool: Your network often acts as a valuable resource pool for guidance, expertise, and opportunities.\n\n\t\t- Increased Resilience: During tough times, a support network provides emotional and practical support, enhancing resilience and the ability to bounce back, which is super important for beginners.\n\n\t\t- Networking Opportunities: A strong support system can help you connect with more professionals, expanding your reach and potential for new opportunities.\n\n\t\t- Motivation Boost: Surrounding yourself with a supportive team can boost morale and motivation, increasing productivity and satisfaction.\n\n\t\t- Innovation Catalyst: Brainstorming with a diverse network can generate innovative ideas and solutions.\n \n\nYou are the only one responsible for making sure you have everything to succeed. So why not build a solid team first to help you along the way. \n\n#personaldevelopment #supportsystem #entrepreneurship #startup #coaching #relationshipbuilding",

        "content": "Ambition is killing you little by little, every single day.\nEspecially if you live in USA.\nAvoid these 3 mistakes to be a better leader and lead a balanced life.\n\nDid you know that U.S comparing to other developed nations with similar public spending on healthcare.\n- Has lowest life expectancy\n- Highest suicide rates\n -Has the Highest Chronic Disease Burden\n\nHealth should matter the most to you especially if you are an ambitious high-achiever. Don't let these statistics and your environment define your longevity and quality of life.\n\nBecause if you do not prioritize your health:\n\n-You will have dysfunctional quality of life especially once you hit 35-40+ y.o.\n-You will not have enough energy and capacity to serve your community and take care of your family.\n-You will eventually adopt destructive coping mechanisms that will kill you prematurely. Like overworking, drug abuse, etc.\n\nSo what are the mistakes we do as ambitious leaders everyday that we should avoid ?\n\nMistake #1: Sacrificing your well-being in the pursuit of goals.\n\nToo often, high-achievers sacrifice their well being with imbalanced lifestyle. Completely disregarding the quality of sleep, diet, exercise and relationships.\n\nInstead, we should be focused on meeting our basic needs first and be assertive in creating boundaries for it to happen. For instance, It can be as simple as creating time blocks for restorative actions. For females it may looks like, taking more frequent breaks during their luteal or menstrual cycle.\n\nAt the end this is what ends up making the biggest difference.\n\n\nMistake #2: Ignoring personal and group emotional distress.\n\n-A bad leader avoids negative emotions and conflict and hopes for it to go away on its own.\n-A good leader can show intentions to resolve the internal and external emotional conflict. (But doesn't prioritize it.)\n-A legendary leader will prioritize and address their own and their teammate's fundamental emotional needs at work:\nAutonomy\nRelatedness\nCompetence\nConflict resolution\n\nThis is what Emotional Intelligence is ultimately about.\n\n\nMistake #3: Lack of awareness of long-term consequences.\n\nWe all think we can push ourselves a little more, just to get to the next round of performance assessment, or to next round of investments, etc.\n\nUntil we can\u2019t.\n\nWhich is why it\u2019s much better to establish personal health-first decision-making system from the very beginning.\n\n\nIn summary, we should prioritize our health by adjusting our behaviors, especially with ambitious mindset. This means:\n\n-Practice and expand your self awareness to meet your basic needs better.\n-Know your health metrics. Have regular medical check ups.\n-Be assertive with your physical, mental and emotional health boundaries.\n\nWhat do you do to keep yourself healthy as an ambitious overachiever?\nIf you do anything at all lol.\n\n#mentalhealth #toxicambition #leadership #health #usa",
